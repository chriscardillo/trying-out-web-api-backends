# Web API Backends
Getting a better understanding of some web API backends.

Exploring:

- Flask
    - ~~Restless~~
    - GraphQL

## How to use

First, make sure to [install and configure Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).

Then, clone this repo.

Finally, open a terminal and `cd` into the repo, then run:

```
docker-compose build
```
This may take a few minutes the run the first time you run it. But once it's complete, run:

```
docker-compose up
```

You'll see the `postgres` and `app` containers start up.
